# norma-ruby

The Natural Object Role Modeling Architect ([NORMA](http://ormfoundation.org)) is a
Visual Studio plug-in for fact-based modeling in [ORM2](http://orm.net).  This gem
loads NORMA's .orm files (which are XML) into a convenient API built using the
[ActiveFacts API](http://github.com/cjheath/activefacts-api). You can read more about
ActiveFacts and ORM2 at [Data Constellation](http://dataconstellation.com/ActiveFacts/).

## INSTALL:

* sudo gem install norma-ruby

## Contributing to norma-ruby
 
* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it
* Fork the project
* Start a feature/bugfix branch
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
